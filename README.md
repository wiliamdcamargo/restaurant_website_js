# Simple DOM and JavaScript Basics

This repository is a simplified implementation of DOM (Document Object Model) concepts and basic JavaScript. It serves as a beginner-friendly resource to help students understand the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and JavaScript imports.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to be straightforward and easy to comprehend, making it an ideal starting point for individuals new to web development.

- **index.html:** The main HTML file representing the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** A simple stylesheet for basic styling.
- **scripts folder:** Contains JavaScript files illustrating basic concepts. Each file focuses on a specific part of the project to aid in learning.

## Getting Started

Open index.html in your preferred web browser to see the basic web page.
Explore the JavaScript files in the src folder to understand and experiment with different concepts.

JavaScript Topics Covered
The JavaScript files in the src folder cover various fundamental topics:

Variables: variables.js introduces the concept of variables.
Functions: functions.js demonstrates creating and using functions.
DOM Manipulation: dom.js showcases simple DOM manipulation.
Imports: imports.js illustrates how to use imports in JavaScript files.

## Usage
Feel free to use this repository as a learning resource. Experiment with the code, modify it, and see how changes affect the web page. This repository is intentionally kept simple to provide a clear understanding of the basics.
